	Description:
	=========
	A block manager with INI style customization file and a dialog box performing 
	collection-grouping, file path display, and slide previews as 'hot thumbnails'.
	Build your own dwg block library with it.
	
	
	Platform:
	======
	HotBlocks had been tested in AutoCAD Release 12/13/14/2000 running on DOS, Win
	95/98 and NT 4.0. It may or may not work in other version and platform. 
	
	What's new:
	=========
	Ver 1.2a is a freeware now. No nag window included.

	Installation:
	========
	There are subdirectories/subfolders inside INSTALL.ZIP, decompress it with all
	subfolders within. 

	- For pkunzip users, use -d parameter. ( e.g. pkunzip -d install.zip c:\ )
	- For WinZip users, check the 'Use folder names' check box in 'extract' dialog box.
	
	That process will create a new folder named 'Hotblock'. It contains: 
		HOTBLOCK.LSP
		HOTBLOCK.DCL
		HOTBLOCK.INI
	   	HOTBLOCK.TXT
		3 sample sub-folders with sample DWG files.

	Start AutoCAD, then include the 'Hotblock' folder as your AutoCAD search-path 
	by invoking "PREFERENCES" command. Restart AutoCAD to apply changes.
	
	
	Running HotBlocks:
	==============
	- For automatic loading each time you begin new drawing session, put this line 
	below in your ACAD.LSP:
	                               (load "HOTBLOCK")
	- For loading HotBlocks manually, type (load "HOTBLOCK") at command prompt.
		
	Type HOTB to start command.
	
	
	Initialization file (HOTBLOCK.INI) format:
	=============================
	You must edit HOTBLOCK.INI to add or change your own drawing library. 
	To see how it works, please also take a look at the sample folder structure. 
	It describes itself more clearly.
	
	The INI structure is:
	----------------------------
	[groupname] 
	Subdir=asubfolder  
	dwgname 
	dwgname
	dwgname
	...
	dwgname
	---------------------------

	groupname: 
	each group name that appears in 'Group' drop-down list box ( e.g [Door] )
	
	asubfolder:
	name of subfolder in your library path that contains all .dwg and .slb files belong
	to related group. Your related .slb file must be named as same as the last subfolder
	in folder-tree.
	e.g. if Subdir=Door ,slide library filename should be Door.slb 
	if Subdir=Kitchen\Sink ,slide library filename should be Sink.slb  ,etc.
	
	dwgname:
	name of dwg file (without extension) listed as an item in 'Item' list box. 
	It must be as same as the related slide name found inside .slb file
	
	
	Slides and Slide Library:
	==================
	Each slide name in .slb file must be exactly as same as each corresponding dwg name.
	For example, in the sample .slb file named HUM.SLB, it contains slides named HUM01,
	HUM02, HUM03, ..., HUM10 to represent .dwg files named HUM01.DWG, HUM02.DWG,
	HUM03, ..., HUM10.DWG. 

	Use SLIDELIB.EXE in AutoCAD's 'support' folder to build your .slb files.

	Each time you want to add a dwg in your own drawing library, you must prepare the 
	drawing itself, create it's slide, and build a slide library containing all slides in	related
	folder. But if you agree, creating so many slides and slide libraries is really torturing !
	I suggest you to download 'Slide Factory' (another freeware stuff from me)  from my 
	web-site. 'Slide Factory' will help you automating the slide-creation process and slide
	library building, make it fast and easy. Try it !
	
	
	Known disabilities:
	==============
	An error occurs if your HOTBLOCK.INI contains a reference to a file that can't be found. 
	So be sure all required files and folders referenced in HOTBLOCK.INI are really exist.
	
	
	Thank you for using HotBlocks v1.2a
